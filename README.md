# Typing Game

This is a simple typing game I created to help users practice their typing skills. Users are presented with a random word, and they must type it as quickly and accurately as possible. The game also includes a virtual keyboard that can be toggled on and off to visualize the keys being pressed.

## Features

- Random word generation from a pre-defined list
- Real-time input validation
- Virtual keyboard display
- Countdown of remaining words
- Calculation of words per minute (WPM)
- Option to restart the game at any time

## How to Play

1. Open the `type.html` file in your preferred web browser.
2. Begin typing the word displayed on the screen.
3. The word will change once you've successfully typed the current word.
4. Continue typing words until the countdown reaches 0.
5. At the end of the game, you'll be shown your WPM score in a popup.
6. Click the "Restart" button to start a new game.

## Customization

If you want to add more words to the game, simply update the `words` array in the JavaScript section of the `index.html` file.

## Browser Compatibility
